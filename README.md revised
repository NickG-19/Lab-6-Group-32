This is Sage, Nick and Anshul's version control lab In our code we are asking for the user to input their name and age(integer) and then we are finding the users birth year by asking them what the current year is and then subtracting that number by their age. Next we are determining what a person's username should be by creating a string that combines their birth year with their name. Lastly we are printing Hello + (what ever the person's name is) + you are + (what ever the person's age is) + years old! and then in the same line we are printing you were born in (what ever year they were born). On the last line we are adding to together and printing what a person's name is plus their birth year.

In order to contribute to this code you need to create your personal fork to this code using this project link: https://github.com/NickG-19/Lab-6-Group-32 on Github and then after that is done send a pull request with your changes and additions. When a person makes a contribution they should keep in mind the whole goal is to ask the user for their name and age and then find a users, birthdate, by asking the user for what the current year is and then subtracting it by the users age and then finding what a printing a suggestion for what a persons name should be by adding a persons name with their birth year. Also in the code we want to greet the user by print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old! You were born in the year " + birth_year), which adds flair to our code by greeting the user and telling them how old they are and what year they were born in.
So if a user can suggest something that improves or adds to the code they should do that, but if it hinders the code they should not do that.

Lastly our code of conduct is important to us and shows it's purpose. We do not want people to write vulgar language in our code, because our code is targeting to all ages and types of people. Also we want people to be respectful towards others and make a great username for our users. In general the goal is to have fun, but respect others. Also don't make negative changes to our code, because we are trying to make our coed as good as possible. We also want collabration on our project and we do not want anyone to be rude or offensive to others.

Our license is copyrighting the work that Sage, Anshul and  Nick originally added to our code, but shows that others can add what they believe improves and elevates our code. Our liecense is shown directly on our repository. Our lievcense also shows that people can widely distribute what our code prints out, but not the exact source code.

So in conclusion we are interested in improvements to our code and making opur code as best as it can be. Looking forward to the positive additions to our code.
